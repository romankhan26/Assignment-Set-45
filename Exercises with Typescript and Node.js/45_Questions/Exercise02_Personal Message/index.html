    <h1><strong>PYTHON(The Most Used Programming Language)</strong></h>
        <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics1. It‚Äôs known for its simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance1. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse1. It‚Äôs often used for Rapid Application Development, as well as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together1.
           <br/>
            Python was designed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 19912. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming2. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected2.
